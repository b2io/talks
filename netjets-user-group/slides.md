## Living Styleguide

Note:
- Hello! 
- I am a UX developer on the Center of Excellence team
- One of my goals as part of this team is to facilitate collaboration and communication between designers and developers as we work together
- One way I'm accomplishing this feat is by spearheading the Living Styleguide initiative

----

## Living Styleguide

 - Creates a common design language

Note:
- Communication is tough, especially across disciplines
- The way that we as developers think of UI components can often differ wildly from how designers think about them
- One way to find common ground is to break designs down into components and set standards around them
 - maybe show some form fields, buttons

----

## Living Styleguide

 - Creates a common design language
 - Composing a UI from the ground up

Note:
- Once we have the basic components of a design figured out, we can use them as building blocks for larger structures in our apps
 - show the form fields assembled into a form
- Here's an example of how we're building out components for the ETM Proof of Concept we're working on
 - show the inventory list components separately and together
